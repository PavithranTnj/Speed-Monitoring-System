# Speed-Monitoring-System
This project aims to enhance road safety by integrating an AI-based speed monitoring system into electric vehicles. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect speed limit signs and automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed accordingly. This will significantly reduce the risk of accidents in areas where speed limits are crucial.
